# Multi-Robot-Mission-Planner

### Project Description
In this project we will create a custom mission planner / ground control station for multi robot systems. In an earlier project a basic mission planner was created which has a web interface where the user can specify line tasks. The goal of this project is to extend this mission planner to allow users to specify more different tasks and configure the robots by adding parameters and constraints. We will also extend the task allocation module to take into account more variables when deciding what robots should do which task. Reallocation of tasks should also be supported if one robot fails.

Ardupilot is the autopilot software used for controlling the robots, and needs to be running on all the robots if using real robots. For simulation we use SITL(Software In The Loop) which is a simulation tool for Ardupilot and is used to simulate different vehicles.
